# Privacy Policy for HeartBud

## Summary

This Privacy Policy outlines how HeartBud handles user information in full compliance with Apple’s App Store requirements and global data protection laws. HeartBud operates entirely on-device, collecting no personally identifiable information, and no data is transmitted to our servers.

## 1. Introduction

HeartBud is a simple pregnancy tracker app that helps users monitor their due date and provides key information through widgets. All information entered into HeartBud is stored locally on the user’s device and is never transmitted to our servers. A Privacy Policy URL is required for all apps in App Store Connect, and this document fulfills that requirement.

HeartBud does not collect any personally identifiable information. The app also does not collect analytics or tracking information. Users are not required to create an account or provide any personal details.

## 3. Use of Information

All data is used solely to calculate and display pregnancy information and related widgets on the device.

## 4. Data Sharing

HeartBud does not share user data with any third parties.

## 5. Data Security

We rely on iOS’s built-in security features to protect all locally stored data.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

HeartBud is not intended for use by children under 4 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 4.

## 7. Your Rights

Users have the right to access, correct, or delete their data at any time by managing the information directly within the app. California residents have the right to know what personal data is collected, request deletion, or opt out of any potential sale of information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
